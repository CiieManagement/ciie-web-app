          "CIIE Description: My first exposure to CIIE was a virtual DSA competition. After winning, I joined the tech club as a volunteer on campus. CIIE has been instrumental in my tech journey, allowing me to organize workshops and multiple editions of hackathons, and to interact and collaborate with some of the best folks on campus. I am grateful to the CIIE team and faculty mentors who made this possible",
