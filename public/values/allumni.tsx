          "CIIE Description: My first exposure to CIIE was a virtual DSA competition. After winning, I joined the tech club as a volunteer on campus. CIIE has been instrumental in my tech journey, allowing me to organize workshops and multiple editions of hackathons, and to interact and collaborate with some of the best folks on campus. I am grateful to the CIIE team and faculty mentors who made this possible",

          "CIIE played an important role during my graduation days. My journey with CIIE fills me with joy and always encourages me to keep pushing forward. In 2019, I started as a student, or I can say as a learner, in CIIE. By 2023, it all ended with me as a Core Team Member. It was tough to carry the legacy of our founding members, but we tried our best so that the fire of incubation, learning, and innovation could be passed down to new minds. Here, I honed technical skills crucial for my career. More importantly, I learned the power of collaboration and innovation. CIIE provided a platform to experiment, fail, and grow. Beyond technical prowess, I gained lasting friendships and mentors (the founding members of CIIE) who guided me through challenges. The experience taught me adaptability and the importance of celebrating failure, because in CIIE, I learned that it's never either you win or you learn; it's always either you win or you lose, but when you can accept your loss, then you learn and grow. All thanks to Ahmed sir for providing this great platform for innovative minds to fly high. ",

          "CIIE is more than just a community I joined. It is a place which grew with me. The time I spent here was one of the most memorable for me because more than learning it was fun to make projects with people from different backgrounds, technical non-technical alike. As a founding member I was supposed to teach here but I always believe that it taught me more than I could return. CIIE gave me the stage and the light to show and grow into the skilled and knowledge hungry person I am right now. Thanks to all the other members who joined with me and the students who came forward to learn along with us. And thanks to Ahmed sir for helping us to set up a place I still feel connected to.",
